		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is David Emmanuel Jourdain. I was born July 5th 1988 in Nyack, New York. I am a very curious person and as a result I tend to be able to speak on any topic with some level of familiarity. I am currently engaged to my girlfriend of 9yrs, and we have a rambunctious 2 year-old named Carter who keeps us very busy. I have too many interests to list them all but I guess you could say I am into anything that could potentially be the topic of a TED Talk.I am pretty open, so anything you need to know is on this site and for anything else you would like to know just ask !</p>
